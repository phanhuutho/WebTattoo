            <p>
                Lash enhancement liner is tattooing the bottom line to top row of lashes, unlike the eyeliner that's tattooed on the top of the lash line to mimic eyeliner. 
                The benefits of lash liner is it gives the illusion of thicker, darker lashes. 
                It's subtle and natural, but makes a distinct difference.
