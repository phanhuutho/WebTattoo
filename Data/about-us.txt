        <p>
            Microblading RVA studio is an open space where we communicate and laugh at each other's stories. 
            Often times, our clients end up talking and everyone's great energy is bouncing off of each other. 
            If that isn't your speed, you're able to request a silent appointment and we will keep the small talk to a minimum. 
            The point is, it's very important for us to make sure every client feels welcomed in our space. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, we have over 200 5-star reviews on Google, I guess that's a plus too.
